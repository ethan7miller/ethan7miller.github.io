<body style="background-color: red"> <H2 Style= "text-align:center"> Atlanta Falcons 2016-17 Season </H2>
<p style= "text-align: left"> <H4> This past year, the Atlanta Falcons enjoyed their most successful year in team history. 
They succeeded in winning the NFC South and made it all the way to the Super Bowl, which was only
the second appearance in team history. Quarterback Matt Ryan enjoyed the best year of his NFL career while also receiving
the MVP Award. The team utilized a high-powered offense combined with a young and improving defense to reach the big game. Unfortuantely, 
the team lost to the Patriots, but they have a set a foundation for success for years to come. </H4>

<p> <H4> Matt Ryan was born in Exton, Pennsylvania and went to William Penn Charter School where he was the star quarterback. After his senior year, he decided to go to Boston College and was the starting quarterback from 2005-2007. In 2007, he was named the ACC Player of the Year and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy. 
In 2008, the Atlanta Falcons drafted him with the 3rd overall pick in the draft in order to try to replace Michael Vick, who went to prison after it was discovered that he was funding his brother's dogfighting club. Since then, he has become the greatest quarterback in Falcons history and holds all of the passing records for the franchise. 
He has received 4 Pro Bowl invitations and multiple other awards throughout his career. </H4>

In 2011, he was drafted 6th overall by the Atlanta Falcons and was immediately expected to contribute as a rookie, which he certainly did. Today, he holds many Falcons receiving records and will eventually go down as the greatest wide receiver in franchise history. </H4>
